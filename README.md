# ControlExperiments

Helps to understand the Basic Control Experiments using LegoEv3 robots, such as,
1.Proportional controller
2.System Identification
3.Proportional Integrator Controller.

This is inspired by previous implementation, however NXT models of LEGO are replaced by LEGO EV3 models. So these set of codes 
are mainly designed for NPTEL MOOC Control Engineering Course. And the codes are written in Python and micropython. Python for plotting 
and visualization, Micropython is the one which runs on the Lego EV3. 

Instructions for installation.

1. Download LEGO EV3 extension in VSCode @ https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lego-education.ev3-micropython
2. Create bootable Micropython image, see for details in @ https://le-www-live-s.legocdn.com/sc/media/files/ev3-micropython/getting-started-with-micropython-v2_enus-810818c6f91786794e324d3e9606b7d2.pdf
   look in to the sectoin : "1.3 Preparing the microSD card" in the above document.
3. Creation Micropython project is also explained in the docs.
